# Introduction {-}

This lab manual is intended as a resources for gaining experience (1) conducting statistical tests in R, (2) reporting results in APA style, and (3) interpreting those results in the context of a given study. It includes a collection of adapted psychology studies based primarily on research conducted by faculty at the University of British Columbia---Okanagan in 2021). For each study you will find a brief introduction, method, and analytic strategy, as well as instructions for producing an R script to conduct the analysis and presenting findings in a brief lab report. As a student using this manual, you can imagine yourself as joining a research team after data have been collected and prior to conducting any analyses. Your job is to conduct the analyses outlined in the analytic strategy, report the results, and interpret them.
